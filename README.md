I don't know about you, but I often, while coding, or doing something else on my PC, listen to Music on youtube in the background.
I have an entire playlist of songs and music mixes on there that I listen to. There is a problem though; when I'm not at home,
I don't really have a way to listen to music in the background, it always uses up way too much data, and I don't even think there is
a shuffle function on mobile.

The obvious solution to this is of course to buy youtube music, but I'm poor so I decided to make this instead.

## The Goal

I want an app that can download youtube videos both in visual form and sound-only. I want to be able to organize these videos and
songs into playlists and listen to them anytime I want in the background.

## What's currently done

- downloading music
- downloading video and audio
- merging video and audio locally (though slow as heck)
- playing downloaded videos and music (sort of patched together though, not finalized at all)
